      <h2>I Always Check My Glucose Summary First. Here's Why.</h2>
      <p>When you're living with Type 1 diabetes like me, every number matters. But it's not just about one reading — it’s about the whole picture. That’s where the Glucose Summary in Glucostats really helps.</p>
      <p>It shows me my average glucose, the highest and lowest values, and how much time I spent in range. I can see right away if I’ve had too many highs, or if I was low during the night.</p>
      <p>There’s even a colored chart that makes it super easy to understand — green is good, red means I need to be careful.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I scroll through the report and think, “Wow, I did better this week!” Other times I notice things I didn’t realize — like how I kept going high after lunch. That helps me and my parents make smarter decisions, like adjusting insulin or changing what I eat.</p>
      <p><strong>I don't just see numbers — I see patterns. And that makes a big difference.</strong></p>
    </div>

  <section class="feature" data-aos="fade-up">
    <img src="img/insulin_doses_per_day.png" alt="Insulin Tracking" class="screenshot">
    <div class="feature-text">
      <h2>Track Your Insulin Usage</h2>
      <p>When I started using insulin, it felt like I was just guessing how much to take. Sometimes I needed more, sometimes less — and figuring out why was really hard.</p>
      <p>That's why I like using Glucostats to track both my bolus (mealtime) and basal (long-acting) insulin. It shows me how much I took each day in easy bar charts, so I can spot changes and trends right away.</p>
      <p>If I've been going low in the afternoons, I can look back and see, "Oh — maybe I had too much bolus at lunch." Or if I've been waking up high, it might mean I need to adjust my basal insulin a little. The app helps me and my parents figure it out together.</p>
      <p>Before, insulin just felt like numbers. Now it makes sense.</p>
      <p><strong>Glucostats doesn't just help me track — it helps me learn what my body needs.</strong></p>
